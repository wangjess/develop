# DjangoReactJason

NEW PROJECT THAT USES DJANGO FRAMEWORK. WORKS!!! 

We are using Django because it gives us a framework and structure to work within. Before we were going to use Flask because it was a lighter weight version of what we need, along with creating our SQLite3 database. But honestly I think we would spend more time looking up how to work these components together (like the freaking SQLite plug-in for React Native apps), basically researching the tech stack, when we kind of need to just get going and creating. Django fits our needs for this class app! (LIek it also creates a db for us!) 
_And you get to add Django experience onto your resume ;)_
